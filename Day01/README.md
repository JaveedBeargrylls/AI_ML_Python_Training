# üòÄ Day 1Ô∏è‚É£ 

## In this day 1 we have covered the below topics related to AI/ML

### AI (Artificial Intelligence):
AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks like reasoning, learning, and decision-making.

### ML (Machine Learning):
ML is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms on data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

### DL (Deep Learning):
DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in large datasets.

### Supervised Learning (S-L):
In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled data to predict outputs for new, unseen inputs (e.g., regression or classification).

### Unsupervised Learning (U-S-L):
Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on data without labels to identify patterns or groupings (e.g., clustering or dimensionality reduction).

### Reinforcement Learning (R-L):
Reinforcement learning is an area of ML where agents learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties.

### Regression:
Regression is a type of supervised learning used to predict continuous outcomes, such as predicting house prices based on features like size.

### Classification:
Classification is a supervised learning task that assigns categories to input data (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not spam).

### Clustering:
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together based on features (e.g., customer segmentation).

### Nominal Deduction:
Nominal deduction involves deriving conclusions based on categorical or nominal data, often using logic or rules to classify items into distinct categories.

### How Algorithms Work:
Algorithms work by following a set of defined steps or rules to process input data and produce an output, optimizing based on the task (e.g., prediction, classification).

### Python Programming Concepts:
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language with features like dynamic typing, easy-to-read syntax, and a rich ecosystem of libraries for tasks like data science, web development, and automation.
